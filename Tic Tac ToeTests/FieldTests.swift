/*
 The rules of the tic tac toe game are the following:

 a game is over when all fields are taken
 a game is over when all fields in a column are taken by a player
 a game is over when all fields in a row are taken by a player
 a game is over when all fields in a diagonal are taken by a player
 a player can take a field if not already taken
 players take turns taking fields until the game is over
 there are two player in the game (X and O)
 */

/*
 1. One field where user can introduce either X or O
 1.1. Creating a field should be an action on its own.
 1.2. A field can have a value/contain a value.
 1.2.1. Make value a concrete type. ~> not implemented
 1.3. One player can introduce a value. At this stage consider only one.
 1.3.1. Define a player
 1.3.2. Define the value ~> Not needed at this stage
 1.3.3. Player can set a value
 1.3.4. Should Field be a value or reference type?
 A field has been set by a given player?
 - Need a way to identify which player is which
    - How to determine that 2 players are equal?
 
 
 1.4. Decide when the user wins a round ~> for this particular case would be only that he introduces a valid value.
